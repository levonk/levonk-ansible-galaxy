## Best Practices for Role Documentation

- **Always document every variable** in a table with: name, default, sample, type, activation (required/recommended/opt-in/opt-out), purpose, and source link.
- **Use explicit enums** for variable activation/requirement status (`required`, `recommended`, `opt-in`, `opt-out`).
- **Link to the source** of each feature/task and variable usage for transparency and maintainability.
- **Provide usage examples** for all major features and variable combinations.
- **Document tags and advanced usage patterns** for selective feature activation.
- **Include explicit notes on idempotency and security** for each feature.
- **Reference external specs or requirements** where relevant.
- **Keep README.md up to date** as the role evolves.
- **Encourage contributors** to follow this template for all new roles and features.
